## Configuation

```lua
require('dap-breakpoints').setup{
  reveal = {
    auto_popup = true,        -- auto show pop up property when navigate to next/prev breakpoint
    conditional = true,       -- enable for conditional breakpoints
    hit_conditional = true,   -- enable for hit conditional breakpoints
    log_point = true,         -- enable for log points
  },
  virtual_text = {
    enable = true,
    current_line_only = false,
    aligned = false,
    prefix = "ó°»‚ ",
    suffix = "",
    spacing = 4,

## Usage

### :DapBpNext

### :DapBpPrev

Goes to the previous breakpoint in file and tries to reveal info about it if possible

### :DapBpReveal

Tries to reveal info about the breakpoint on the current line if possible

### :DapBpUpdate

Tries to allow you to update a log point message or breakpoint condition for a breakpoint on the line you are currently on.

### :DapBpClearVirtText

Clears virtual text revealing information about breakpoints within current buffer.

### :DapBpShowVirtText
